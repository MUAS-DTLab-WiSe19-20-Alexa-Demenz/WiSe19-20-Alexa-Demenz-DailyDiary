# Alexa Skills Kit SDK - Daily Diary 

## - OpenSource Project -
The Alexa skill is a project which is initiated by students of the Munich University of Applied Science and provided as an open source software, which makes it free to use for anyone.

## Idea:

Daily Diary is meant to help people, who suffer from diseases, that invoke regular memory loss like Alzheimers` Disease and/or Dementia.
For those patients it offers a variety of scheduling- and planning-abilitys, which can be used to help memorize certain events for example with your beloved family members or friends.
The idea is to help regaining confidence in daily activities and to re-improve quality of life to a certain level. 

## Concept:

The user is recording his daily tasks via voice interaction with for example an Alexa Device or his mobile phone. 
These interactions create "events" up to a certain detail. Data of these events can be date, time, place, participants, name of the event and details. 
After saving those, your device will tell you about an incoming event at a certain time in front of the event and will ask you afterwards, what happenend.
Later on, the user can relisten to his past and future events as well.

## Used Technology:
The skill uses the Alexa Skill Service from Amazon Web Service. We have created the skill with the Alexa Developer Console. The Source Code (business logic) is written with Java JDK.
The DynamoDB database (Amazon Web Services) is used to store the events.

## Supported Languages:
At the moment the skill is only available in German.

## Invocation Name:
Daily Diary
